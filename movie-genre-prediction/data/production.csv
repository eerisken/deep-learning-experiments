In 1946, Isaac Woodard, a Black army sergeant on his way home to South Carolina after serving in WWII, was pulled from a bus for arguing with the driver.

The event also ultimately set the stage for the Supreme Court’s landmark 1954 Brown v.

Daniele is a young man from Sant’Erasmo, an island on the edges of the Venice Lagoon.

Daniele too dreams of a record-breaking barchino, one that will take him to the top of the leader board, but everything he does to further his dream and win respect from the others turns out to be tragically counterproductive. The decline that erodes the relationships, environment and habits of a rootless generation is observed from the timeless perspective of the Venetian landscape and its island outskirts: the point of no return is a foolish, vestigial tale of male initiation.

With this film I wanted to experiment with intercutting, superimposition and color. Similar to my previous short film ""Vilja til å handle forhasta"", I chose some footage from a recent trip as a basis. I created two different scenes using superimposition that the film intercuts between slowly increasing in speed before culminating into a harmonious relationship of color. Accompanying the visuals is a beautiful piece of classical music pitched up and down respectively for each shot before returning to it's full glory in the culmination sequence. As in my previous work, I once again returned to the idea of intermissions in short films again with allusions to other films. The final shot or act of the short film was conceived in the same spirit as the first act as it pictures one of my favorite spots during my trip.","Adventure, Crime, Music, Science Fiction",10.0,1,1721870334,1721870340,bad
