# Complex-Valued Facial Emotion Recognition

This project implements a **facial emotion recognition (FER) system** using **complex-valued neural networks**.  
By leveraging complex representations, the model can better capture subtle facial features and temporal patterns in the data.

## Features

- **Complex-valued CNN architectures** for improved feature representation
- **Support for multiple facial emotion categories** (e.g., happy, sad, angry, etc.)
- **Training and evaluation pipelines** with PyTorch
- **Easily extendable** to other emotion datasets
