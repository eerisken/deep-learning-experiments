# Deep Learning Experiments

Welcome to my Deep Learning Experiments repository!

This repository is a personal collection of experiments, prototypes, and explorations in the field of deep learning. It includes implementations using popular frameworks like **PyTorch** and **TensorFlow**, and covers a wide range of topics such as:

- Neural network architectures
- Training techniques and optimizations
- Computer vision tasks
- Natural language processing
- Reinforcement learning
- Transfer learning
- Model evaluation and visualization

## üìÅ Structure

The experiments are created using Google Colab and organized by topic or project.

- `LTN.ipnby`: an experiment with Logic Tensor Networks for Multi-Label Classification of movie-genres using PyTorch and ltntorch package.
